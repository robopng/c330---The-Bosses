# Project: Adaptive Shadow

## Adaptive AI Arena Fighter - Cycle 1 & 2 Deliverables

**Project Adaptive Shadow** is a 2D, top-down, single-player arena fighter. The game's core innovation is a central AI boss designed to **observe, learn, and adapt** its combat strategy to counter the player's unique fighting style.

This repository contains the deliverables for **Cycle 1** and **Cycle 2**, laying the foundation for advanced adaptive AI systems in future development cycles.
